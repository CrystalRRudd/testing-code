# testing-code
I am attempting to put code on here

Well it seemed to work.

This is basically a game of Nimm that the has the computer always winning.
It starts with 15 balls and has the player chose a number between 1-4.
Then it subtracts that number from the total amount of balls giving a new number.
Then it is the computers turn. It will choose the number of balls that has the remaining balls%5=0.
It continues until there are no balls remaining.

*This is the last lab assignment I completed for class*
